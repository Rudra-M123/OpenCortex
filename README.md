# OpenCortex
A python project using Ollama and any supported LLM that behaves like a smart virtual assistant.
### How to Use
Download all prerequisite APIs as mentioned through the import statements. Ollama and an LLM of your choice must be on your computer. From here, download a specific version into a directory on your computer and run "Main.py". From here, the program will prompt you for further details until you reach the main prompting window. From here, you can prompt it anything. If the prompt appears as an existing action, it will perform that. Otherwise, the user has the option for the program to "learn" the action, or just answer the question through regular prompting. Once an operation is complete, you are returned to the main prompting window where you can provide another prompt and continue.
## Version 1
Features STT+TTS, assistant querying with web fallback, and an action learning system.
## Version 2
Will feature multi-turn conversation, subprompting and more, coming soon...
